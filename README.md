NSTableView Mac Example


This is a simple OS X application that shows how to open a document and how to present informations on a NSTableView.


This program reads a file with a .tri (for a triangle) or a .sqa(for a rectangle) extension and then prints informations about the geometric forms within the file.

An example of a .tri file for a triangle would be:

4;4;4

1;2;3

3;4;5


Note that you have to use ";" to separate the sides


An example of .sqa rectangle would be:

3;4

2;2
